            Lily Learns to Share is a children book, about a little squirrel named Lily who loves collecting acorns but never shares them with her friends, Max and Mia. One night, a strong wind scatters all her nuts. The next day, Max and Mia kindly offer her food, and Lily realizes how good it feels to share. Grateful, she gathers extra acorns for her friends and learns that kindness and generosity make everyone happier.
